# DevOps by Example

## Introduction

This repository is meant to be a collection of notes on DevOps topics from a very practical point of view. It's mainly to show you how to do things by example. Because many operations require multiple technologies, each page will be tagged with a suitable list of subjects and technologies. There is also a [quick lookup page](./quick-look-up.md) that lists tags and pages tagged with the tag to help you find pages faster.

There is also a [template file](./template.md) you can use to structure your `By Example` page. It is just a guide and don't feel constrained by it.
